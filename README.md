# Open Pokedex Project
## Basic functions
This app allows you to search for a pokemon and see some of it's details. This includes the pokemon:
- Name
- Number
- Type
- HP value
- Attack and special attack values
- Defense and special defense values
- Speed. 
You can also save pokemon to your local pokedex as well as discover new pokemon by means of a random list of 10 pokemon.
*There is currently a missing feature that should let you calculate the damage one pokemon will deal to another. Expect it very soon.*
